# QuantumBoundStateSpectrum
Investigating the seperation of energies for the Bound State Spectrum relative to both the Quantum Harmonic Oscillator and Infinite Square Well

Plots Energy Separation for Bound State Spectrum, Infinite Square Well, Quantum Harmonic Oscillator, as well as the Wavefunctions and Expectation Values for the different solutions of the Schr√∂dinger Equation given different potentials.

There may be issues with the kinetic energy terms, these are to be fixed in a later patch.
